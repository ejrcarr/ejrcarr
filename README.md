<h3>Chess Engine AI</h3>
<p>I enjoy playing chess in my free time which led to me to create a desktop app with <em>Java/Swing/MySQL</em>. Since most chess platforms have paywalls, I decided to create my own application to analyze my past games. It included a customized engine and scraped over 2,680,000+ past chess games from previous professional games to use as book moves. It was my first real application so I tried working according to SOLID principles. The design was modeled after chess.com's website and the GUI works similar as well. The GUI follows chess procedure, highlights legal moves for a clicked piece, indicates taken pieces, and displays chess notation of game. The engine uses a minimax algorithm based on piece value, mobility, development, king safety, and pawn structure using object-oriented programming. </p>


**Tech Stack**: Java, Swing, JDBC, MySQL

<h2>Interests</h3>
Anything computer science interests me, particularly <strong>web development</strong>. Early August I began working on <a href='https://www.theodinproject.com/'>The Odin Project</a> and was super fascinated by the process. 
<br />
<br />
Other than coding, I like collecting sneakers or hanging out with my two dogs. I also enjoy relaxing with my girlfriend watching TV.
